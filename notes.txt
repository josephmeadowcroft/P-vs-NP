Computational Complexity
- robot logic puzzle
- how the problem scales -> increasing comp complexity
- began studying which problems are solvable using an algorithm and which are impossible to crack
- led to finding not all problems are the same -> sorting problems into classes of easy vs hard
- therefore P vs NP was born

Defining P and NP
- p defintion and examples
- np definition and examples
- np completeness?

Does P = NP?
- mathmeticians have made algorithms to solve np problems in a reasonable time 
- np --> p
- are all np problems really p problems?

The consequences
- positive consequences if P = NP
- negative consequences

Where do we currently stand on the problem?
- most csers believe p does not equal np
- hard to prove due to natural proof barriers
- if civilisation lasts long enough p vs np may be solved by us or by AI
