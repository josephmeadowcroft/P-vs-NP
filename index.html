            The P vs NP problem is the most famous unsolved problem in computer science, first brought to light in 1971 by Stephen Cook in his article about "The complexity of theorem proving procedures".<br><br>
            The problem, in it's simplest terms:

                A robot arrives in a foreign land, where everyone always tells the truth, or always lies. The robot reaches a fork in the road with two paths, one leading the land of the truth tellers, and one leading to the land of liars.<br><br>
                A sentinel appears in front of the robot, allowing him to ask one question to find which path leads to the safe land of the truth tellers, however it is unclear which land this sentinel comes from.<br><br>
                What question should the robot ask to find the right path?

                Computational complexity theorists study which problems are solvable by an algorithm, and which are almost impossible to crack. This leads to a natural classification as we find that not all problems are the same.

                P (Polynomial) problems are a class of problems that algorithms can solve quickly, within polynomial time. Polynomial time algorithms are programs where running time grows as a polynomial function of the size of its input.

              <p>
                e.g. finding the largest number in a list, addition, subtraction, finding factors of a number, the majority of things we use our computers for on a daily basis

                NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial) problems includes problems whose solutions can be verified quickly, also within polynomial time, but cannot necessarily be solved quickly. Complexity increases exponentially as inputs increase.

                In the early 1970s, complexity researchers realised that dozens of the NP problems they were struggling with all essentially the same problem at their core, resulting in a subset of NP problems known as <span class="underline">NP-Complete</span> being created, a subset including all the really hard parts of NP problems. Since then, many more problems have been added to the list of NP-Complete problems, such as sudoku, protein folding, and even classic video games such as Tetris or Super Mario Bros.
                <br><br>
                A fast problem used to solve an NP-Complete problem could be used to solve any problem within NP. Hence why sudoku is pretty hard, as it contains the same NP-Complete paths that makes protein folding hard, so if you come up with a profoundly faster way to solve sudoku, make sure you let somebody know as it could help us to cure cancer.

              Over the years, mathmaticians have found clever algorithms to solve NP problems in a reasonable amount of time, moving them into the class of P problems (from hard to easy), and making them solvable by a computer, thus resulting in the questions...

              Around 81% of computer scientists believe that P does not equal NP, however this is difficult to prove due to something called natural proof barriers.

              There is always ongoing research regarding a solution to this problem, to eventually prove if all NP problems are in fact P problems or not. If civilisation lasts long enough, I believe P vs NP will eventually be solved...
